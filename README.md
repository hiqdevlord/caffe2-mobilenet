## Intro
Reimplement ["MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications" by Andrew G. Howard et. al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf)ï¼Œ I got 89+% accuracy on cifar10 dataset. Because cifar10 image size is 32, smaller than imagenet, so I reduce some downsampling operation. This is refer to [shicai/MobileNet-Caffe](https://github.com/shicai/MobileNet-Caffe). My code is not elegant.
